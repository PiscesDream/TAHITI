The X86 architecture has support for hardware-assisted task switching by way of a list of Task State Segments (TSS). In this tutorial set we have (like BSD, linux and most x86 operating systems) decided against using it and opted instead for a software based solution. The main reason for this is that hardware task switching is actually not much faster than software, and software task switching is far more portable between platforms

In many operating systems, the full features of the TSS are not used.[36] This is commonly due to portability concerns or due to the performance issues created with hardware task switches.[36] As a result many operating systems use both hardware and software to create a multitasking system.[37]
